### 1. User Access to the Server

- **Request-Response Flow**: Users access the server by sending requests through the REST API, and the server responds accordingly.
- **Purpose of REST API**: REST API enables communication between client and server by following a standardized request-response model over HTTP.

---

### 2. Accessing the Server via URL

- **Server URL Format**:
    - The base URL format for accessing the server is structured as `server:port`.
    - Example URL: `http://172.17.18.19:8080`
        - Here:
            - `172.17.18.19` is the serverâ€™s IP address.
            - `8080` is the port on which the server service is running.
    - This address must be accessible for the client to communicate with the server.

- **Running the Server**:
    - A `.jar` file is typically deployed and executed on the server at this address, allowing the application to start and listen for incoming HTTP requests.

### 3. Endpoint and HTTP Verbs

- **Accessing Endpoints**:
    - An endpoint is a specific path on the server that the client can access, following the format `http://server:port/endpoint`.
    - The URL alone is not enough to access server functionality; the client must use an appropriate HTTP verb to define the type of action being requested.

- **HTTP Verbs (Methods)**:
    - **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
    - **POST**: Send new data to the server.
    - **PUT**: Update existing data on the server.
    - **DELETE**: Remove data from the server.
    - REST API relies on these HTTP verbs to perform operations based on the URL and method used.

- **REST API Equation**:
    - REST API = HTTP Verb + URL
    - By combining a URL with the appropriate HTTP verb, the client can specify the action they want the server to perform.

### 4. REST Controller in Spring Boot

- **@RestController Annotation**:
    - In Spring Boot, `@RestController` is a specialized controller annotation that combines the functionalities of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
    - Any method within a class annotated with `@RestController` will have its return value automatically converted into JSON format and sent in the HTTP response.
    - This makes it easier to build RESTful APIs, as the JSON conversion happens automatically for every method in the class.

- **Components**:
    - `@Controller`: Marks the class as a controller, making it available to handle HTTP requests.
    - `@ResponseBody`: Ensures that the return value of each method in the class is included in the HTTP response body, typically in JSON format.

---

### 5. Reusing URLs for Different Operations

- **Unified URL with Multiple HTTP Verbs**:
    - A single URL endpoint can support multiple operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the HTTP verb used in the request.
    - However, each HTTP method is allowed only once per unique combination of URL and HTTP verb.
    - Example:
        - `http://172.17.18.19:8080/api/resource`
            - **GET**: Retrieve data for the resource.
            - **POST**: Create a new instance of the resource.
            - **PUT**: Update the existing resource.
            - **DELETE**: Delete the resource.

Improvements Made

    Validation Annotations:
        Added @NotBlank for title validation in JournalEntry entity.

    Null/Blank Checks:
        Used Optional with filter to handle blank or null fields more cleanly in the update logic.

    Error Handling:
        Simplified error handling and ensured meaningful HTTP response statuses.

    Documentation:
        Added JavaDoc comments for better readability and maintainability.

    Secure Controller:
        Avoided exposing too much error information to prevent leaking sensitive details.

    Best Practices:
        Removed redundant repository methods (e.g., findById in JournalRepository, as JpaRepository already provides this).

    Spring Validations:
        Incorporated basic input validations using annotations to enforce constraints.
